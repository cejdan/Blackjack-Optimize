README

This project contains a working Blackjack game for your Python console (except that currently the Split feature is incomplete)

If you want to play Blackjack and you are a human, you will want to run Blackjack_v1.5_forHuman.py

If you are an AI or a robot, you will want to run Blackjack_v1.6_forAlgo.py
(BEWARE, this file currently has a major bug which prevents it from finishing a test run) This file is under development. The plan is eventually to have a working metaheuristic which gets close to the optimal "mathematically proven" decisions to maximize player profits.


The only dependency is the package Random.
It was build using Python 3.7
